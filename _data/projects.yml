  description: "An SRPArray is formed by antenna elements separately carried by multiple unmanned aerial vechicles (UAVs). The reconfigurable spatial arrangment of antenna elements is achieved by <b>high-speed and highly accurate phase synchronization</b> among UAVs, by which an SRPArray can potentially have better deployment flexibility and performance."
